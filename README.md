# Telugu NLP Corpus Processing & Morphological Analysis

This project involves comprehensive processing of the Telugu Wikipedia corpus to support Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, especially in low-resource language contexts. The work spans both preprocessing and advanced morphological analysis.

## Features

- **Sentence Splitting**: Segmentation of raw Telugu text into clean sentence units  
- **Sentence Statistics**: Computation of word counts, sentence lengths, and other metrics  
- **Text Cleaning & Conversion**: Removed unwanted characters and standardized corpus to `.txt` format  
- **N-gram Generation**: Created unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and higher-order n-grams  
- **Stopword Handling**: Identified and filtered out Telugu stopwords  
- **Morphological Analysis**: Analyzed word structures to extract roots, affixes, and POS tags (using rule-based/statistical tools)

## Tech & Tools Used

- Python (Text processing, file I/O)
- Regular Expressions
- Indic NLP Library / Custom scripts
- Morfessor / Rule-based morphological analyzers
- Bash scripting for batch tasks
- UTF-8 handling for Indian language text

## Purpose

This project contributes to building reusable and structured NLP datasets for Telugu, enabling better model performance in translation, tagging, classification, and other linguistic applications.
